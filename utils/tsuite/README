  Legend:

    - Launcher is the machine where tsuite is executed from.
      It may be a build server or even laptop.  Any diffs in the tree
      where tsuite is launched from are copied to the trees for the
      suite invocation.  The launcher is responsible for suite execution
      coordination directly by SSH'ing to each node specified by the
      testing suite.

    - Bounce is an optional host primarily for situations where node
      pools are behind an internal network.

    - Node pool are hosts directly specified in the testing suite
      configuration.

  Other services, such as mail and database, are accessed depending on
  the invocation parameters of tsuite.

Setup notes
-----------

(1) The user tsuite runs as ("tsuite-user") must have sudo privileges.

(2) SSH pubkeys must be set up on each node so tsuite-user can SSH to
    the localhost on each node, which may be used by some tests.

(3) TMPDIR has to be setup.  Really, all the configuration in the tsuite
    configuration file needs to be checked and true.
