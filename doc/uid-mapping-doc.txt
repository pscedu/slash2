UID/GID mapping is done at the client side _before_ permission checking using either
ACL or traditional Unix mode bits.  UID/GID mapping is enabled by giving a map file.
The following is a sample map file (extra space and comments starting with # will be 
ignored):

	user remote 43666 local 1000
	group remote 15313 local 1001
	group local 1001 remote 15313

The above map file does the following:

	- map local user ID 1000 to remote user ID 43666 and _vice versa_. The same
	  effect can be achieved with the following line:
	
		user local 1000 remote 43666
 
	- map remote group ID 15313 to local group ID 1001.
	- map local group ID 1001 to remote group ID 15313.

Note that group mapping is one way only, either from local to remote or from remote 
to local.  This opens the possibility of mapping multiple groups of one side to one 
group on the other side.

If a user does not have explicit mapping, he or she will be treated as nobody and 
nogroup.  This makes sure that a user does not gain more privileges accidentally.

UID/GID mapping allows a user or a group of users to gain access to files without
actually changing the onwership of these files.
