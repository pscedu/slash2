Motivation:

	* Remove the dependency of MDS on ZFS-fuse so that it can run on any file system.

		<-- might take advantage of the new features of kernel resident file system
		    such as quota.

	* All metadata are user visible files.

	* Help MDS run as non-root.

	* No more confusion between zfs-fuse toolchains and ZFS-on-Linux toolchains (which 
	  ones to use).

	* Use file handle is more efficient than going through the FID namespace.

	* We still have workaround with ZFS-fuse.  For example:

		zfs_rmnode, skipping znode: mount = 1, id = 820768619
		zfs_rmnode, skipping znode: mount = 1, id = 820776170
		zfs_rmnode, skipping znode: mount = 1, id = 820780706
		zfs_rmnode, skipping znode: mount = 1, id = 820759349

	* After removing a huge number of files in a directory, the ls performance of
	  that directory never recovers (after reboot, etc).  Sounds like a performance bug.

	* No more ZFS-fuse crashes and ZFS arc_evict issues.

Feasibility:

	* We can always create links in the user space, but the open-by-handle feature
	  in the kernel makes it more efficient.

Things to change:


	* All RPCs will have to change to replace a fid with a file handle.

		- currently we path 64-bit FID around.  The value of MAX_HANDLE_SZ is 128.

		- Do I need to add a sequence number to all RPCs to deal with out-of-order
		  arrivals?

	* All slash2 per-file metadata must be store in a file.  Right now, we modify
	  ZFS inode to store some slash2 specific inode information (e.g., zp_s2nblks
	  and zp_s2ptruncgen).

	  Other information like owner, permission can stay.

	* Journaling code. We don't know when the file system flushes its caches, so a 
	  replay can fail. Also, we need a way to reclaim log space - use syncfs().
	
	  Each log entry can be associated with a file descriptor.  The log entry can
	  only be reclaimed after the file is synced.  This way, we can avoid syncing
	  the entire file system.

	  Replay made easy because we never re-use FID, we never truncate.

	  Instead of using a system wide transaction group ID, we can use generation number 
	  associated with different parts of a file to determine whether we should reply a log
	  entry (bmap generation number, inode generation number, etc).  The generation number
	  is stored in each log entry.

	* We still need to keep the FID name space. Our replication script uses it and
	  it can be a quick way to do FID->name mapping.

	  Also, the IOS uses FID to do I/O.

	* Right now, the state of bmap take 3 bits.  We can make it 4 bits so that (1)
	  allow future growth (2) easier to implement and debug.

Obstacle:

	* This is a on-disk format change.

		- mandatory: we have to store things like slash2 file size ourselves.

		- currently the metadata file of slash2 file can be huge. Last time
		  I looked, some CRC fields are probably not needed any more.

		- since we have on-disk format change, we might as well do the following:

			- combine ino and inox, add a version to inode
			- increase number of IOS per inode from 64 to 1024
			- get rid of CRC stuff.
			- use extended attributes to specify the target IO servers
			  for each file.

		- Add generation number to each data structure that can be updated atomically
		  for log replay.  Also protect each data structure with CRC checksum.

		- Add version number to each data structures to allow piece meal upgrade.

		- Currently, we use some ZFS fields to store slash2 attributes, we won't be able
		  to touch file system inode at all.

	* ZFS-fuse has some xattr that are constructed on the fly (e.g.,  SLXAT_INOXSTAT)
	  used by dumpfid.c.  It might also have something to do with scans (/opt/packages/slash2/scans),
	  ask Ed.

Concerns:

	* The new MDS will take some time to stablize.

	* There will be work needed to migrate existing data to the new MDS code.

	* How to deal with upcalls from ZFS to log namespace operations, etc.?


<yanovich> so it *should* entail just replacing mdsio-zfs.c
<yanovich> that was my plan long ago
<yanovich> but we laced way too many hooks
<yanovich> also, there is a lot of functionality that you have to replace (if you so choose), like the zfs send/recv and 
	   raidz3 and everything else provided (unless you switch to a system that provides that..)
<yanovich> i am sorry but i do not have any time right now to review anything that would require serious attention
