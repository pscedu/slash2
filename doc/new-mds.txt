Motivation:

	* Remove the dependency of MDS on ZFS-fuse so that it can run on any file system.
	* All metadata are user visible files.

Feasibility:

	* We can always create links in the user space, but the open-by-handle feature
	  in the kernel makes it more efficient.

Things to change:


	* All RPCs will have to change to replace a fid with a file handle.

	* All slash2 per-file metadata must be store in a file.  Right now, we modify
	  ZFS inode to store some slash2 specific inode information.

Obstacle:

	* This is a on-disk format change.
