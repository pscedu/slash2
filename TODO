* Bmpce Write
There may be some advantage to maintaining a seq or numeric window id for
each bmpce being processed for write.  Right before the bmpce is put on the
wire, the current window is closed and proceeding biorq's using that bmpce
must wait for the next window (and completion of the pending RPC).  This
is to prevent the same bmpce from being on the wire twice.  It should also
augment the coalescer by allowing for later writes to be included.  The
main change here is that biorq's could have their bmpces complete in totally
different rpc's or even rpcsets.  Essentially the biorq doesn't complete
until the window id for each bmpce is <= than the last processed bmpce window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Restore Issues:
1) need to split 64-bit inode space into upper and lower segments.  Each
   MDS in the system will be given a start # and range for use in the upper
   segment.  The upper value will be incremented on restore (when the
   journal does not agree with the cursor) or when all IDs in the lower
   segment have been exhausted.

2) How does sliod and mds deal with the LWM in post restore scenarios?
   Atm, the sliod doesn't like when the LWM decreases.
3) How do we deal with CRC's and size updates which were lost on mds restore
4) distillation XID - how do we cope with this when the journal has been reformatted

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Pending I/O Issues:
	. Sliod threads may be get tied up servicing requests from a
	failed client or client connection.  If the socket doesn't immediately
	fail, the rpc's need to time out.  This can cause requests from other
	clients to accumulate on the sliod, these requests could time out also.
	Worse yet, the leases for the blocked clients may expire causing
	more problems.  Unfortunately, all of this is exacerbated by the
	lack of flow control and aggressive read ahead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- there should be a slictl/msctl cmd to see other/aggr replicas:

	(o) msctl -s repl-disk-usage:file[,...]

TRUNCATE

Truncate is more of a problem because the fid+gen remains, thus making async IOS
truncate operations problematic because new writes may come from the client before
the truncate is processed by the IOS (whoops!).  Client to IOS truncate ops are
also unfavorable because replica maintenance may need to be done, the client may have
the replica table but should he be the one directing the truncates to all IOS's?
I'm inclined to say 'no'.  Care must be taken here so that we don't hurt performance
for (O_CREAT|O_TRUNC) of existing files which is the case where the fid+gen is not
changed.  As an optimization we could possibly delete the file on the mds first,
invoking the GC routines for that fid+gen and then create a new inode.  Of course
this may break semantics for some apps which assume the same inode # to be used.

* Truncate Implementation
  - holdup:
     (o) sliod needs to perform the actual truncate via the slvr API
     (o) sliod then needs to send a CRC update
     (o) MDS needs to account for ptrunc/trunc changes in st_blocks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* ./fio.pthreads -i MTWT_SZV.ves -- This test is causing unnecessary RBW requests.

* Deal with problems surrounding full odtable. ATM odtable put errors are not dealt with properly
leading to problems later in cfdfree where the bmap refcnt is wrong.

11/23/09
* mds_bmap_ion_assign fails when the caller doesn't specify a PIOS.

11/02/09
* msl_io and rpc ION calls need to return actual size so that read() can
be short circuited on EOF.

09/23/09
* Sliod has too many open files but reports success anyway to mount_slash.

* Sliod runs out of space in filesystem and returns from an rpc early (client sees the rc -28)
	the problem is that other sliod threads are blocked on a waitq and are never woken
	up.  Need a way to deal with the failure mode.

* While running a small file / create intensive fio test, I find that most of the threads
are blocking here waiting for rpc completion.  This makes things like 'ls -al' very slow
because no threads are left to process incoming operations.

Thread 4 (Thread 0x50fa7940 (LWP 31008)):

Actually, if all of the operations performed in slash2fuse_release could be done
asynchronously then performance would be greatly improved.
- this should be safe too, as FUSE guarentees to call flush() before release().
  however, perhaps the problem is that flush().

Well, after increasing the number of fuse threads to 48 I don't see the entire set blocked
in release but I don't see good performance for 'ls -al'.

* Fidcache Generation Numbering
	Fidcache must support generation numbers.
		. hash table code should be modified to add a cmp function.
		. ambiguous inode lookups should prefer the highest gen #

	On the fidcache generation # subject.  Implementing the FC with gen #'s is
	awkward because fuse does not provide the generation number except when it
	provides an 'fi'.  This means that the gen cannot be used for hash table lookups
	taking place on behalf of operations like: create, mkdir, open,	etc.

	Done but seeing a problem on the client when doing stress testing:
	[1233201864:695906 msfsthr9:__fidc_lookup_fg:320] [assert] fcmh_2_gen(tmp) != FID_ANY

	Not seeing the above on the server..

------------------------------------------------------

- add some high-level aliases to the replication interface for users:

  mid-level persistence control aliases:
    $ slfctl [-R] -p file ...				# msctl -f new-repl-policy=persist
    $ slfctl [-R] -o file ...				# msctl -f new-repl-policy=onetime
    $ slfctl -B bmapspec:file ...			# msctl -f bmap-repl-policy=persist
    $ slfctl -b bmapspec:file ...			# msctl -f bmap-repl-policy=onetime

  mid-level replication request control aliases:
    $ slfs replstatus [-R] file ...			# msctl [-R] -r file -r...
    $ slfs replqueue [-R] res[,...]:bmapspec:file ...	# msctl [-R] -Q spec -Q...
    $ slfs replremove [-R] res[,...]:bmapspec:file ...	# msctl [-R] -U spec -U...

  high-level aliases:
    $ slfs replicate [-Rp] res[,...] file ...
	if (-p)
		slfctl [-R] -p file ...
	msctl [-R] -Q res,...|*[P]:file ...
    $ slfs replcancel|cancel [res,...] file ...
	if (-p)
		slfctl [-R] -o file ...
	msctl [-R] -U res,...|*[P]:file ...
    $ slfs setpersist file ...
	slfctl -p file ...
	slfctl -B *:file *:...
    $ slfs setonetime file ...
	slfctl -o file ...
	slfctl -b *:file *:...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- libsl_init() is getting an ENOMEM somewhere in slashd, maybe LNET
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removing the persistence policy on a bmap should mds_repl_delrq()
  for that bmap
- merge set_bmapreplpol into fattr interface
- push O_APPEND writes always to EOF instead of the client-sent offset

- allow multiple preferred IOS servers to get rid of necessity of making
  subsets of IOS (sense345 e.g.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

sliod import
- slictl import path
    other approaches:
    (o) link into slfidns, calculate and transmit CRCS,
	delete link from user path.
    (o) link into slfidns, calculate and transmit CRCs,
	wait for CRC failure and auto deject.

sliod export
- slictl export path
    lookup path FID and move file to destination
    if recursive, lookup recursively

---------------------------------------------------------

upsch/network scheduling
- investigate activemq
   - http://activemq.apache.org/index.html
- need slcfg rules to specify link bandwidth/topology?
- fix starvation problem denying fairness to data in same priority class

netsched/libnetsch - universal interface, kinda like Grand Central
  - interface with kernel
  grand central dispatch for net
   (o) LD_PRELOAD?
   (o) intercept for recompiling
   (o) API
   (o) needs to communicate with other nodes about traffic situation

tracks endpoint connections
- if new ones are made that utilize the same link, manage and
  limit and wait until bandwidth is available

- per-site network upscheduling is not enough; it has to be per link to
  maintain network link saturation effectively

- must consider multiple interfaces

MDS must do this for scheduling traffic between sliods

- networking scheduling:
   (*) knowledge of topological intrinsics, especially important in the WAN,
   (*) dynamic adjustment to live conditions,
   (*) honor local (system and user) prioritization,
   (*) interplay with other network services in a reasonable yet (likely)
       advisory fashion,
   (*) integration of this knowledge into the selection of POSIX I/O
       arrangements
networking exploration
- interface/link rates bandwidth
- remote site link path
- specification for reservation policies





------------------------------

- convert authbuf to pki, put hash back inside bdbuf fdbuf
  reasoning: if authbuf succeeded, we trust anything, so there is no
  point in having extra provisions such as src ION

  consequence: kill authbuf
- in the meantime, expand slkeymgt to make per-client authbufs with uid
- sprinkle some iostats on zfs, namespace changelog
- add journal I/O test mode to slashd

---------------

- failure of connections
    (o) write messages to stderr of the process trying to do I/O when
	the connections are down, or maybe TTY

- add throttling and ping channel control

utime
    (o)	track how long sliod has held the I/O and send the difference to
	the MDS so the MDS can more accurately estimate when the I/O
	took place

tree
- rename the zfs_init() alias, it is already a routine in ZFS
- rename slconfig.h to slcfg.h to disambiguate slco prefix

API rename
- rename FCMH_CREATE to LOAD?
- mdsio_fid_t -> mdsio_inum_t

- ensure PINGs only happen every 30 seconds
- ensure GETATTR should never return nlinks=0
- replace FCMH_CTOR_FAILED with fmi_ctor_rc
- slmkfs -W should instead should rename the top-level its contents in
  the (forked) background after returning quickly to admin
  . not sure about the removal step.  Why not make use of a UUID that's
  generated by the MDS and provided as a parameter to the sliod slmkfs
  operation?  So we'd have something like:  /s2io/{UUID}/.slmkfs
  The UUID could be just a timestamp too.  This would allow admins to
  remove old backing directories at their convenience while not
  compromising data integrity.

- if the target ptrunc offset falls inside a bmap, do more stuff:
    (o) mark the CRC for this bmap as unknown (we don't do this)

- use pfl_memchk instead of null inode structures for memcmp
- CRCs are currently ignored in the I/O path
- need a general mechanism to pass data between msctl/slictl/slmctl
  so we get all the functionality everywhere and don't have to copy huge
  chunks of code
- ensure all system errno values in rpc msgs are standardized
  - ETIMEDOUT 60 (BSD) vs 110 (linux)
  - ECONNABORTED
  - ECONNREFUSED
  - ECONNRESET
  - EHOSTDOWN
  - EHOSTUNREACH
  - ENETDOWN
  - ENETRESET
  - ENETUNREACH
  - ENOTCONN
- convert CONF_LOCK to a rwlock
- we can't hold fcmh in memory at all times just because PTRUNC has to
  be resolved.  have to store in inode and release fcmh.  we pass the
  fid to the ptrunc worker and when it processes it loads the fcmh.
- have slashd umount /zfs-kstat on teardown
- allow override of /zfs-kstat for running multiple instances of slashd/zfs-fuse
- add a generic SRMT_BMAPCTL that bunches up ops such as WAKE, RELEASE,
  DIO, etc.
- do full truncate and unlink do the right things while ptrunc is resolving?

- write a ptrunc tester: or just use truncate(1) or a dd(1) that does truncate(2)
- for -s connections, we arguably do not need to show members of the
  same resource we are part of since we will never connect to them
- patch fuse.ko since fuse_notify_entry_inval() causes segfault
- client needs to track when MDS goes down and recheck pinned ptrunc
  bmaps for resolvement
- on MDS resm failure inside msl, clear a bit on all fcmh's pinned by ptrunc
  whenever we check this flag, if the bit is not set, issue an RPC so
  that we get registered with the MDS to be notified when ptrunc resolves
- need way to specify in slash.conf other sites without MDS which MDS
  should be responsible for replications to resources at that site

      global pref_mds=md@PSC

- pjd tests used to fail due to inability to send FUSE updates to its
  cache after UNLINK, RENAME operations?

	link/00.t	18-19, 22, 44-45, 48
	rename/00.t	49, 53, 57, 61
	unlink/00.t	17, 22, 53

========================================================= KNOWN CAVEATS
- sljournal constraint on small file names (1023-byte symlink must fit
  in SLJ_NAMES_MAX):

- FUSE bug: during LOOKUP, there is no check for invalidated dirs to
  re-force lookups for child nodes.

  if this gets resolves, we should remove the code that explicitly
  invalidates FUSE child dentries of a directory when handling CHMOD

- move namespace in zfs into a subdir so we dont have to do any
  strcmp(fn, ".slmd") -> EPERM tricks

- make sure replrq over garbage does the right thing in sliod backfs (zeroing)
- mds: do not allow repl changes while IN_PTRUNC
- should replay crcupdate set ion to VALID ?
- for long running I/O patterns by processes that issue no other syscalls,
  do fcmh's timeout and reload from MDS sst_size/gen values?
    - need fcmh_get() in mslfsop_read()
- try locally caching st_blocks in msl
- msl with sst_size local caching should still take higher values from MDS
  in cases of direct I/O (or maybe sliod)
- use uint32_t for nanosecond atime/mtime/ctime in znode_phys to save space
- 'slmctl stop' should completely wait for all ops to prevent relying on journal
- upsch will not scale without multiwait waker arg
- ensure user mode mounting works
- add provisions to ensure journal disk doesnt overwrite something special
  (superblock check)

- Add the ability to remove an I/O server from slcfg.  Right now struct
  reclaim_prog_entry has a field "pad".  Should be easy to turn it into
  a flag to mark obsolete entries.  But we need a tool or edit the disk
  file manually to be compatible.

  We might want to do the same thing for metadata server.
   - write a tool to purge specified IOS's from the garbage reclaim log files

- msctl is broken on 32-bit because of ino # compression
- have msctl access a special $DIR/.slctlsock file?
- move msctl sock to $MOUNTPOINT/.slmd/ctlsock and have msctl ascend to
  that on arguments?
- add authbuf file path to slcfg

reimport
- add a scanner to DELETE things in .slmd/fidns with st_nlink==1 in sliod

- debug lnrtd
- cluster_noshare replication changes
   - use a random resm, just like regular I/O
   - specify degree of multiresidency with

       $ msctl -Q cluster@SITE=3:bnospec:file,

     for 3 copies on the cluster

- replay setattr (not result of SETATTR, but result of another action
  which indirectly issues setattr code) bugs:
   (o) rename doesn't replay parentdir mtime setattr
   (o) crc update doesn't replay nblks setattr

- watch out for EMFILE on freebsd
- wolverine/single cpu missed wakeup
- file system-level and/or xattr replication controls, e.g.

    $ cp myfile .slrpl/foo@BAR
    $ ls .slrpl/myfile
    foo@BAR
    bar@FOO
    $ rm .slrpl/myfile/foo@BAR

    $ setfattr -n .slrpl-ios@SITE:4-8 myfile
    $ getfattr myfile

- kill -D argument; provide arg/slcfg var for authbuf key
- add -d arg to daemons to stop daemonization and make that behavior
  default in developer builds
- test msctl -Q <symlink>
- uptime instance nonce variable that allows msl to dump data if it
  changes while communicating with sliod
   (o) mark new flag on msl csvc when upnonce changes in CONNECT

- convert MDS rcmc.c to async RPCs
- add du(1) functionality in dumpfid via extattr
- add slmctl -ss fstypes for linux with f_type
   - parse /proc/mounts if it's there for sliod statfs f_fstype
- make macro version of accessors for speed in gdb (e.g. bmap_2_bmi())
  inline are for debugging/gdb
- expose SLASH2 non-POSIX (e.g. repl) interface through extattr magic
- fix bug when no IODs are online yet CLI writes are somehow successful
- UNLINK is very slow when interspersed with READDIR

- TRUNCATE should wipe out the inode reptbl
- fix round robin among senses when open(O_TRUNC) -- prefer old IOS
- make cursor file contents ASCII for debugging
- do journal logs for SETATTR factor in nlink, nblks, etc??
- while :; do dmesg > file; done      produces lots of EBADMSG from sliod

- investigate diaser(1)
- listxattr returns ERANGE
- extattr are broke
- ENOENT on GETATTR and REPL_RQ_ADD produce ERANGE
- msl timeout change no longer waits when server offline, EIO immediately
- client should not psclog ERRORs from SLERR_AIOWAIT on WRITE/READ RPC
- fix bug when src ION comes online and upsch doesn't know he should now
  try to schedule some new work
    -- upsch_multiwait should be getting woken, needs a PAGEIN for dst though...
    -- maybe add PAGEIN for src?
- make sure when RPC fails that disconnect() is called and the structure
  actually goes entirely away to avoid 'duplicate CONNECT msg received'
  stuff and so callback handlers are run to ensure consistency in protocols
- some combination of truncate(2) or O_TRUNC and replication can produce
  corrupt files with no valid bmaps as rbudden has discovered
- RPC standardized error messages:
   - ENOSTR = ETIMEDOUT between BSD and Linux, and the client
     will not treat ENOSTR as an RPC error
- msctl repl-policy read isnt implemented
- user quotas??
   - track user database when crc updates come in with st_blocks
     and fail new write assignments when over quota
- atime??
- Not all items on the flush queue are flushable.  We may want to defer
  putting an item on the queue until it is flushable.  dd-test.sh can
  have thousands of pending biorqs.
- slm_ptrunc_wake_clients() may need to use rpcsets or nbreqsets to deal
  with large numbers of blocking clients.  Or, the algorithm should be
  modified so that the clients retry after some brief sleep period.  (I
  believe this is how DIO works).
- FID modifications details in docs/supporting_recovery.txt.  Without
  these changes we'll be forced to modify internal MDS structures
  manually and will be forced to restart all clients and sliods.
- imported files should create CRCs
- stash directory replication settings in dir/.sldir
- ensure flush() wakeups are being called from failed/timedout RPC
  callbacks
- import should utilize fallocate(2) where available
- because we use cryptography, rely less on peer IP addresses for
  authentication to allow clients behind internal networks
- what happens when a single replica on a write disabled ios tries to
  get modified?  what should happen??
- replication notification service
- tuck reclaim/update logs in a subdir in .slmd
- bump size of reclaim/update logs files to create less
    - 48K -> 1MB
- getxattr(2) family (e.g. zfsslash2_getxattr()) should return ENOATTR/ENODATA
- get rid of XCTL and reuse xattr interface with special .sl prefix
- have sliod persistently track CRC updates in case of failure
- some IOS seem to get reclaim updates when they have never been online
- does IOS need to send REPLSCHED back to MDS?  won't crcupd suffice?
- merge PFLERR_NOTCONN with SLERR_ION_OFFLINE
- get rid of FIDC_LOOKUP_LOAD
- are these messages from successful replication?

- when write IO is done in mount_slash, we should set BREPLST_VALID
  if it isn't
- check svn histories for when small I/Os performance broke
- we should reload the file inode in CLI from MDS
  (o) normal attr expiration
  (o) specifically when mtime gets updated (uptime mtime when ino changes)
- is fuse OPEN for mmap/dio still broke?  double check and open
  turn off PSCFS_OPENF_DIO for non-X_OK files on older fuse
- we should move the mds_bmap_crc_write() code that turns off SGID and
  SUID bits on the file to mds_bmap_ion_assign()
- we should use a flag SETATTRF_MTIME_NOW that updates a file's mtim
  to whatever is the current time on MDS instead of using the client's
  time specified
- ctlsvr messages specified as 0 may accept any sized requests
  (also cap maximum ctlmsg size allowed)

- merge authbuf bulkhash and hash into single buf
- sessid from mount_slash 'file closed' info psclog is not correct
- progname from mount_slash 'file closed' info psclog is not correct
- reclaim logs should be async as synchronous waiting doesnt scale with
  large numbers of deletes

- metadata constitutes almost as much as the data????
MDS:
peer-54321-128.182.99.27@tcp10-rcv          32.6M
peer-54321-128.182.99.27@tcp10-snd          25.3M
IOS:
peer-54321-128.182.99.29@tcp10-rcv          17.8M
peer-54321-128.182.99.29@tcp10-snd          46.1M

- CLI should ensure connection to IOS is actually valid as the
  connection is initiated in non-block mode, so CONNECT waits,
  until it times out then EIO/ENOTCONN comes.  by this logic,
  asynchronous FLUSH should be OK as long as connection is actually
  established
- add 'msctl softstop' that exits when all procs are done
- add tunables ctlparam - similar to opstats
- add ctl -p pid to get the pid

- remove ./src/lib/libsolkerncompat/include/sys/zfs_debug.h


- zfs snapshot
   -> tie callback into something that COW's all odtables+journal

- add crcalg=old option

- this breaks:
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=r000 seek=1M count=1 bs=64k
	md5sum r000

- this breaks:
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=r000 seek=1G count=1 bs=64k
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=r000 seek=1M count=1 bs=64k

upsch
- optimize queries by reordering SELECT verbs

st_blocks
- account metadata overhead in st_blocks?
- fix ios_nblks[idx] and aggr accounting on setsize0 and ptrunc

- implement dedup in IOS with CRC checking and upsch?

- ask paul about difficulty of CRCs

- readdir optimizations
   (o) can we avoid an rpc when st_size==2?  This involves knowing the inum for ".."

- wrapper scripts:
   - purge old corefiles
   - purge long-running psclogs (if no restarts, no opportunity to clear
     old logs)

- caching exploration
   (*) read caching for clients to serve other local clients
   (*) read-ahead to improve performance through locality exploitation
       ("pre-replication")
   (*) write push-through caching for efficient remote I/O staging

- cryptographic authentication integration (Kerberos/X.509/etc.)
- per-client authbuf.key with uid= to control untrusted clients
   slkeymgt to manage/issue keys
- are crcupdates coalescing?  seems we are generating many mdslog
  entries for SETSIZE appends
- support quotas by using s2size in dmu_objset_do_userquota_callbacks ->
  do_userquota_callback -> zap_increment_int

- replication notification service, informing users when workloads have
  finished, launching a job, etc.

- use global mount to supported distributed MDS, no forwarding after initial contact,
  no division of a pool into multiple file systems.



ls /slfs/.slfidns/0x101010 should return ENOENT not ERANGE
   (bad site ID?)

zfs
- trimthr is taking 100% CPU on MDS

slashd
- rcm mutex csvc decref crash from repl-status
- arc_get_buf OOM crash

- piggyback small GETXATTR/LISTXATTR directly into RPC

add rpc xid to psc_log_fmt

- fuse: bad error value: 101 (ENETUNREACH) probably from bmap_to_csvc
1297480 fuse: bad error value: 504

VM images for slash2?

- msctl -S or infer sockfn from mountpoint name:
   msctl -r /supercell/tmp/foo
     -> statfs() parent dir until fsid changes
     -> connect(AF_LOCAL, .slctlsock)

honor .slmd/resid on startup for MDS and IOD


move from splay -> redblack in bmpc_biorq


- failed replication need to reset upschdb
- batchrq is reaching limit then hanging

would fuse_reply_poll help us?
would fuse_reply_ioctl help us in place of msctl?

unify setting st_blksize for all of:
- getattr
- setattr
- create
- mknod
- link
- lookup
- mkdir
- symlink

use XATTR_MAXNAMELEN to check on xattr name length

unnecessary lock contention?
mount_slash/io.c:

 729                                 len = msl_pages_copyout(r, q);
 730                                 MFH_ULOCK(q->mfsrq_mfh);
