* Bmpce Write
There may be some advantage to maintaining a seq or numeric window id for
each bmpce being processed for write.  Right before the bmpce is put on the
wire, the current window is closed and proceeding biorq's using that bmpce
must wait for the next window (and completion of the pending RPC).  This
is to prevent the same bmpce from being on the wire twice.  It should also
augment the coalescer by allowing for later writes to be included.  The
main change here is that biorq's could have their bmpces complete in totally
different rpc's or even rpcsets.  Essentially the biorq doesn't complete
until the window id for each bmpce is <= than the last processed bmpce window.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Restore Issues:
1) need to split 64-bit inode space into upper and lower segments.  Each
   MDS in the system will be given a start # and range for use in the upper
   segment.  The upper value will be incremented on restore (when the
   journal does not agree with the cursor) or when all IDs in the lower
   segment have been exhausted.

2) How does sliod and mds deal with the LWM in post restore scenarios?
   Atm, the sliod doesn't like when the LWM decreases.
3) How do we deal with CRC's and size updates which were lost on mds restore
4) distillation XID - how do we cope with this when the journal has been reformatted

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
* Pending I/O Issues:
	. Sliod threads may be get tied up servicing requests from a
	failed client or client connection.  If the socket doesn't immediately
	fail, the rpc's need to time out.  This can cause requests from other
	clients to accumulate on the sliod, these requests could time out also.
	Worse yet, the leases for the blocked clients may expire causing
	more problems.  Unfortunately, all of this is exacerbated by the
	lack of flow control and aggressive read ahead.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
- there should be a slictl/msctl cmd to see other/aggr replicas:

	(o) msctl -s repl-disk-usage:file[,...]

TRUNCATE

Truncate is more of a problem because the fid+gen remains, thus making async IOS
truncate operations problematic because new writes may come from the client before
the truncate is processed by the IOS (whoops!).  Client to IOS truncate ops are
also unfavorable because replica maintenance may need to be done, the client may have
the replica table but should he be the one directing the truncates to all IOS's?
I'm inclined to say 'no'.  Care must be taken here so that we don't hurt performance
for (O_CREAT|O_TRUNC) of existing files which is the case where the fid+gen is not
changed.  As an optimization we could possibly delete the file on the mds first,
invoking the GC routines for that fid+gen and then create a new inode.  Of course
this may break semantics for some apps which assume the same inode # to be used.

* Truncate Implementation
  - holdup:
     (o) sliod needs to perform the actual truncate via the slvr API
     (o) sliod then needs to send a CRC update
     (o) MDS needs to account for ptrunc/trunc changes in st_blocks

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

* ./fio.pthreads -i MTWT_SZV.ves -- This test is causing unnecessary RBW requests.

* Deal with problems surrounding full odtable. ATM odtable put errors are not dealt with properly
leading to problems later in cfdfree where the bmap refcnt is wrong.

11/23/09
* mds_bmap_ion_assign fails when the caller doesn't specify a PIOS.

11/02/09
* msl_io and rpc ION calls need to return actual size so that read() can
be short circuited on EOF.

09/23/09
* Sliod has too many open files but reports success anyway to mount_slash.

* Sliod runs out of space in filesystem and returns from an rpc early (client sees the rc -28)
	the problem is that other sliod threads are blocked on a waitq and are never woken
	up.  Need a way to deal with the failure mode.

* While running a small file / create intensive fio test, I find that most of the threads
are blocking here waiting for rpc completion.  This makes things like 'ls -al' very slow
because no threads are left to process incoming operations.

Thread 4 (Thread 0x50fa7940 (LWP 31008)):

Actually, if all of the operations performed in slash2fuse_release could be done
asynchronously then performance would be greatly improved.
- this should be safe too, as FUSE guarentees to call flush() before release().
  however, perhaps the problem is that flush().

Well, after increasing the number of fuse threads to 48 I don't see the entire set blocked
in release but I don't see good performance for 'ls -al'.

* Fidcache Generation Numbering
	Fidcache must support generation numbers.
		. hash table code should be modified to add a cmp function.
		. ambiguous inode lookups should prefer the highest gen #

	On the fidcache generation # subject.  Implementing the FC with gen #'s is
	awkward because fuse does not provide the generation number except when it
	provides an 'fi'.  This means that the gen cannot be used for hash table lookups
	taking place on behalf of operations like: create, mkdir, open,	etc.

	Done but seeing a problem on the client when doing stress testing:
	[1233201864:695906 msfsthr9:__fidc_lookup_fg:320] [assert] fcmh_2_gen(tmp) != FID_ANY

	Not seeing the above on the server..

------------------------------------------------------

- add some high-level aliases to the replication interface for users:

  mid-level persistence control aliases:
    $ slfctl [-R] -p file ...				# msctl -f new-repl-policy=persist
    $ slfctl [-R] -o file ...				# msctl -f new-repl-policy=onetime
    $ slfctl -B bmapspec:file ...			# msctl -f bmap-repl-policy=persist
    $ slfctl -b bmapspec:file ...			# msctl -f bmap-repl-policy=onetime

  mid-level replication request control aliases:
    $ slfs replstatus [-R] file ...			# msctl [-R] -r file -r...
    $ slfs replqueue [-R] res[,...]:bmapspec:file ...	# msctl [-R] -Q spec -Q...
    $ slfs replremove [-R] res[,...]:bmapspec:file ...	# msctl [-R] -U spec -U...

  high-level aliases:
    $ slfs replicate [-Rp] res[,...] file ...
	if (-p)
		slfctl [-R] -p file ...
	msctl [-R] -Q res,...|*[P]:file ...
    $ slfs replcancel|cancel [res,...] file ...
	if (-p)
		slfctl [-R] -o file ...
	msctl [-R] -U res,...|*[P]:file ...
    $ slfs setpersist file ...
	slfctl -p file ...
	slfctl -B *:file *:...
    $ slfs setonetime file ...
	slfctl -o file ...
	slfctl -b *:file *:...

------------------------------------------------------------------------

- libsl_init() is getting an ENOMEM somewhere in slashd, maybe LNET
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- removing the persistence policy on a bmap should mds_repl_delrq()
  for that bmap
- merge set_bmapreplpol into fattr interface
- push O_APPEND writes always to EOF instead of the client-sent offset

- allow multiple preferred IOS servers to get rid of necessity of making
  subsets of IOS (sense345 e.g.)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

sliod import
- slictl import path
    other approaches:
    (o) link into slfidns, calculate and transmit CRCS,
	delete link from user path.
    (o) link into slfidns, calculate and transmit CRCs,
	wait for CRC failure and auto deject.

sliod export
- slictl export path
    lookup path FID and move file to destination
    if recursive, lookup recursively

---------------------------------------------------------

upsch/network scheduling
- investigate activemq
   - http://activemq.apache.org/index.html
- need slcfg rules to specify link bandwidth/topology?
- fix starvation problem denying fairness to data in same priority class

netsched/libnetsch - universal interface, kinda like Grand Central
  - interface with kernel
  grand central dispatch for net
   (o) LD_PRELOAD?
   (o) intercept for recompiling
   (o) API
   (o) needs to communicate with other nodes about traffic situation

tracks endpoint connections
- if new ones are made that utilize the same link, manage and
  limit and wait until bandwidth is available

- per-site network upscheduling is not enough; it has to be per link to
  maintain network link saturation effectively

- must consider multiple interfaces

MDS must do this for scheduling traffic between sliods

- networking scheduling:
   (*) knowledge of topological intrinsics, especially important in the WAN,
   (*) dynamic adjustment to live conditions,
   (*) honor local (system and user) prioritization,
   (*) interplay with other network services in a reasonable yet (likely)
       advisory fashion,
   (*) integration of this knowledge into the selection of POSIX I/O
       arrangements
networking exploration
- interface/link rates bandwidth
- remote site link path
- specification for reservation policies





------------------------------

- convert authbuf to pki, put hash back inside bdbuf fdbuf
  reasoning: if authbuf succeeded, we trust anything, so there is no
  point in having extra provisions such as src ION

  consequence: kill authbuf
- in the meantime, expand slkeymgt to make per-client authbufs with uid
- sprinkle some iostats on zfs, namespace changelog
- add journal I/O test mode to slashd

---------------

- failure of connections
    (o) write messages to stderr of the process trying to do I/O when
	the connections are down, or maybe TTY

- add throttling and ping channel control

utime
    (o)	track how long sliod has held the I/O and send the difference to
	the MDS so the MDS can more accurately estimate when the I/O
	took place

tree
- rename the zfs_init() alias, it is already a routine in ZFS
- rename slconfig.h to slcfg.h to disambiguate slco prefix

API rename
- rename FCMH_CREATE to LOAD?
- mdsio_fid_t -> mdsio_inum_t

- ensure PINGs only happen every 30 seconds
- ensure GETATTR should never return nlinks=0
- replace FCMH_CTOR_FAILED with fmi_ctor_rc
- slmkfs -W should instead should rename the top-level its contents in
  the (forked) background after returning quickly to admin
  . not sure about the removal step.  Why not make use of a UUID that's
  generated by the MDS and provided as a parameter to the sliod slmkfs
  operation?  So we'd have something like:  /s2io/{UUID}/.slmkfs
  The UUID could be just a timestamp too.  This would allow admins to
  remove old backing directories at their convenience while not
  compromising data integrity.

- if the target ptrunc offset falls inside a bmap, do more stuff:
    (o) mark the CRC for this bmap as unknown (we don't do this)

- use pfl_memchk instead of null inode structures for memcmp
- CRCs are currently ignored in the I/O path
- need a general mechanism to pass data between msctl/slictl/slmctl
  so we get all the functionality everywhere and don't have to copy huge
  chunks of code
- ensure all system errno values in rpc msgs are standardized
  - ETIMEDOUT 60 (BSD) vs 110 (linux)
  - ECONNABORTED
  - ECONNREFUSED
  - ECONNRESET
  - EHOSTDOWN
  - EHOSTUNREACH
  - ENETDOWN
  - ENETRESET
  - ENETUNREACH
  - ENOTCONN
- convert CONF_LOCK to a rwlock
- we can't hold fcmh in memory at all times just because PTRUNC has to
  be resolved.  have to store in inode and release fcmh.  we pass the
  fid to the ptrunc worker and when it processes it loads the fcmh.
- have slashd umount /zfs-kstat on teardown
- allow override of /zfs-kstat for running multiple instances of slashd/zfs-fuse
- add a generic SRMT_BMAPCTL that bunches up ops such as WAKE, RELEASE,
  DIO, etc.
- do full truncate and unlink do the right things while ptrunc is resolving?

- write a ptrunc tester: or just use truncate(1) or a dd(1) that does truncate(2)
- for -s connections, we arguably do not need to show members of the
  same resource we are part of since we will never connect to them
- IOS that do not connect to an MDS (outside a site) will never be upsch
  scheduled
- use F_FREESP on Solaris to implement replication ejection
- msattrflushthr_main should be async
- use-after-unlink also affects directories

- client needs to track when MDS goes down and recheck pinned ptrunc
  bmaps for resolvement
- on MDS resm failure inside msl, clear a bit on all fcmh's pinned by ptrunc
  whenever we check this flag, if the bit is not set, issue an RPC so
  that we get registered with the MDS to be notified when ptrunc resolves
- need way to specify in slash.conf other sites without MDS which MDS
  should be responsible for replications to resources at that site

      global pref_mds=md@PSC

- pjd tests used to fail due to inability to send FUSE updates to its
  cache after UNLINK, RENAME operations?

	link/00.t	18-19, 22, 44-45, 48
	rename/00.t	49, 53, 57, 61
	unlink/00.t	17, 22, 53

========================================================= KNOWN CAVEATS
- sljournal constraint on small file names (1023-byte symlink must fit
  in SLJ_NAMES_MAX):

- FUSE bug: during LOOKUP, there is no check for invalidated dirs to
  re-force lookups for child nodes.

  if this gets resolves, we should remove the code that explicitly
  invalidates FUSE child dentries of a directory when handling CHMOD

- move namespace in zfs into a subdir so we dont have to do any
  strcmp(fn, ".slmd") -> EPERM tricks

- make sure replrq over garbage does the right thing in sliod backfs (zeroing)
- mds: do not allow repl changes while IN_PTRUNC
- should replay crcupdate set ion to VALID ?
- for long running I/O patterns by processes that issue no other syscalls,
  do fcmh's timeout and reload from MDS sst_size/gen values?
    - need fcmh_get() in mslfsop_read()
- try locally caching st_blocks in msl
- msl with sst_size local caching should still take higher values from MDS
  in cases of direct I/O (or maybe sliod)
- use uint32_t for nanosecond atime/mtime/ctime in znode_phys to save space
- 'slmctl stop' should completely wait for all ops to prevent relying on journal
- upsch will not scale without multiwait waker arg
- ensure user mode mounting works
- add provisions to ensure journal disk doesnt overwrite something special
  (superblock check)

- Add the ability to remove an I/O server from slcfg.  Right now struct
  reclaim_prog_entry has a field "pad".  Should be easy to turn it into
  a flag to mark obsolete entries.  But we need a tool or edit the disk
  file manually to be compatible.

  We might want to do the same thing for metadata server.
   - write a tool to purge specified IOS's from the garbage reclaim log files

- msctl is broken on 32-bit because of ino # compression

reimport
- add a scanner to DELETE things in .slmd/fidns with st_nlink==1 in sliod

- debug lnrtd
- cluster_noshare replication changes
   - use a random resm, just like regular I/O
   - specify degree of multiresidency with

       $ msctl -Q cluster@SITE=3:bnospec:file,

     for 3 copies on the cluster

- replay setattr (not result of SETATTR, but result of another action
  which indirectly issues setattr code) bugs:
   (o) rename doesn't replay parentdir mtime setattr
   (o) crc update doesn't replay nblks setattr

- watch out for EMFILE on freebsd
- wolverine/single cpu missed wakeup in lnet?
- file system-level and/or xattr replication controls, e.g.

    $ cp myfile .slrpl/foo@BAR
    $ ls .slrpl/myfile
    foo@BAR
    bar@FOO
    $ rm .slrpl/myfile/foo@BAR

    $ setfattr -n .slrpl-ios@SITE:4-8 myfile
    $ getfattr myfile

- kill -D argument; provide arg/slcfg var for authbuf key
- test msctl -Q <symlink>
- uptime instance nonce variable that allows msl to dump data if it
  changes while communicating with sliod
   (o) mark new flag on msl csvc when upnonce changes in CONNECT

- convert MDS rcmc.c to async RPCs
- add slmctl -ss fstypes for linux with f_type
   - parse /proc/mounts if it's there for sliod statfs f_fstype
- make macro version of accessors for speed in gdb (e.g. bmap_2_bmi())
  inline are for debugging/gdb
- expose SLASH2 non-POSIX (e.g. repl) interface through extattr magic
- fix bug when no IODs are online yet CLI writes are somehow successful
    - dup?: EIO is not being delivered to app when IOS is down
- UNLINK is very slow when interspersed with READDIR

- TRUNCATE should wipe out the inode reptbl
- fix round robin among senses when open(O_TRUNC) -- prefer old IOS
- make cursor file contents ASCII for debugging
- do journal logs for SETATTR factor in nlink, nblks, etc??
- while :; do dmesg > file; done      produces lots of EBADMSG from sliod

- investigate diaser(1)
- ENOENT on GETATTR and REPL_RQ_ADD produce ERANGE
- msl timeout change no longer waits when server offline, EIO immediately
- client should not psclog ERRORs from SLERR_AIOWAIT on WRITE/READ RPC
- fix bug when src ION comes online and upsch doesn't know he should now
  try to schedule some new work
    -- upsch_multiwait should be getting woken, needs a PAGEIN for dst though...
    -- maybe add PAGEIN for src?
- make sure when RPC fails that disconnect() is called and the structure
  actually goes entirely away to avoid 'duplicate CONNECT msg received'
  stuff and so callback handlers are run to ensure consistency in protocols
- some combination of truncate(2) or O_TRUNC and replication can produce
  corrupt files with no valid bmaps as rbudden has discovered
- RPC standardized error messages:
   - ENOSTR = ETIMEDOUT between BSD and Linux, and the client
     will not treat ENOSTR as an RPC error
- msctl repl-policy read isnt implemented
- idea to support user quotas?
   - track user database when CRC updates come in with st_blocks
     and fail new write assignments when over quota
- Not all items on the flush queue are flushable.  We may want to defer
  putting an item on the queue until it is flushable.  dd-test.sh can
  have thousands of pending biorqs.
- slm_ptrunc_wake_clients() may need to use rpcsets or nbreqsets to deal
  with large numbers of blocking clients.  Or, the algorithm should be
  modified so that the clients retry after some brief sleep period.  (I
  believe this is how DIO works).
- FID modifications details in docs/supporting_recovery.txt.  Without
  these changes we'll be forced to modify internal MDS structures
  manually and will be forced to restart all clients and sliods.
- sliod-imported files should create CRCs
- ensure flush() wakeups are being called from failed/timedout RPC
  callbacks
- import should utilize fallocate(2) where available
- because we use cryptography, rely less on peer IP addresses for
  authentication to allow clients behind internal networks
- what happens when a single replica on a write disabled ios tries to
  get modified?  what should happen??
- replication notification service
- tuck reclaim/update logs in a subdir in .slmd
- bump size of reclaim/update logs files to create less
    - 48K -> 1MB
- getxattr(2) family (e.g. zfsslash2_getxattr()) should return ENOATTR/ENODATA
- get rid of XCTL and reuse xattr interface with special .sl prefix
- have sliod persistently track CRC updates in case of failure
- some IOS seem to get reclaim updates when they have never been online
- does IOS need to send REPLSCHED back to MDS?  won't crcupd suffice?
- merge PFLERR_NOTCONN with SLERR_ION_OFFLINE
- get rid of FIDC_LOOKUP_LOAD
- are these messages from successful replication?

- open file descriptors after UNLINK run into risk of accessing

- changes made by upsch dont get reverted in sqlite because they aren't
  written to disk so don't go through slm_repl_upd_write
- when write IO is done in mount_slash, we should set BREPLST_VALID
  if it isn't
- is small I/Os performance broken?
- we should reload the file inode in CLI from MDS
  (o) normal attr expiration
  (o) specifically when mtime gets updated (uptime mtime when ino changes)
- we should move the mds_bmap_crc_write() code that turns off SGID and
  SUID bits on the file to mds_bmap_ion_assign()
- we should use a flag SETATTRF_MTIME_NOW that updates a file's mtim
  to whatever is the current time on MDS instead of using the client's
  time specified
- ctlsvr messages specified as 0 may accept any sized requests
  (also cap maximum ctlmsg size allowed)

   - parallelize far and toolchain on tg-login (scp/sftp/ssh-tar)
   - after successful first I/O: cache all user requests in memory
- add psclog log_format fmtstr specifier for slashd to get hostname of
  client in rmc
- bmap.odtab, ptrunc.odt, op-* should not be on SSD
- why aren't cursor and bmap.odt getting updated?
- add TRIM support to our zfs-fuse
- DEBUG_BMAP() should do everything inside the shouldlog()
- can errors be injected into our scheme circumventing authbuf?
	- at the LNET level: yes
	- at the SLASH2 level: no
- if high priority work cannot be done in upsch, do some lower priority
  work
- bia odtable should move to /dev/shm
- lots of time in fidlink() lookup

- CLI should ensure connection to IOS is actually valid as the
  connection is initiated in non-block mode, so CONNECT waits,
  until it times out then EIO/ENOTCONN comes.  by this logic,
  asynchronous FLUSH should be OK as long as connection is actually
  established

- remove ./src/lib/libsolkerncompat/include/sys/zfs_debug.h


- zfs snapshot
   -> tie callback into something that COW's all odtables+journal

- add crcalg={none,basic,fastcry} option?

- this breaks:
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=r000 seek=1M count=1 bs=64k
	md5sum r000

- this breaks:
	dd if=/dev/urandom of=r000 seek=1G count=1 bs=64k

   (*) read-ahead to improve performance through locality exploitation
       ("pre-replication")
   (*) write push-through caching for efficient remote I/O staging

- cryptographic authentication integration (Kerberos/X.509/etc.)
- per-client authbuf.key with uid= to control untrusted clients
   slkeymgt to manage/issue keys
- are crcupdates coalescing?  seems we are generating many mdslog
  entries for SETSIZE appends
- support quotas by using s2size in dmu_objset_do_userquota_callbacks ->
  do_userquota_callback -> zap_increment_int

- replication notification service, informing users when workloads have
  finished, launching a job, etc.


ls /slfs/.slfidns/0x101010 should return ENOENT not ERANGE
   (bad site ID?)

slashd
- rcm mutex csvc decref crash from repl-status
- arc_get_buf OOM crash

- piggyback small GETXATTR/LISTXATTR directly into RPC

add rpc xid as pflog log_format specifier

- fuse: bad error value: 101 (ENETUNREACH) probably from bmap_to_csvc
1297480 fuse: bad error value: 504

- msctl -S or infer sockfn from mountpoint name:
   msctl -r /supercell/tmp/foo
     -> statfs() parent dir until fsid changes
     -> connect(AF_LOCAL, .slctlsock)
- move msctl sock to $MOUNTPOINT/.slctlsock and have msctl ascend to
  that on arguments?

honor .slmd/resid on startup for MDS and IOD


- failed replication need to reset upschdb
- batchrq is reaching limit then hanging

would fuse_reply_poll help us?
would fuse_reply_ioctl help us in place of msctl?

unify setting st_blksize for all of:
- getattr
- setattr
- create
- mknod
- link
- lookup
- mkdir
- symlink

  slmctl -sc refcnt leaks

- use XATTR_MAXNAMELEN to check on xattr name length
- how do multiple application thread streams affect mount_slash
  readahead tracking?  can the mfh store per-thread streams?  any
  benefit?
- ensure readahead window can properly fill 10gE, 20gE, 40gE, 100gE
- bim_getcurseq() shouldnt hold a mutex during an RPC:
- hash slcfg and use as a verify sanity check when connecting to peers
- does mount_slash flush_attr_wait impose synchronous SETATTR flush
  waiting on I/O path?
- change IP addr for sliod in slcfg *on client slcfg only* and notice
  ERANGE returned to fuse
    - also, attrflush threads sends SETSIZE RPC to MDS, even though
      no data is received by IOS
- replace lockedlists with dynarrays:
	- sli_replwk_active
	- msctl_replsts
- lnet export refcnt leak: export@0xefbee0 ref=5664
- get rid of fmid_dino_mfid and fmid_dino_mfh
- write FSUUID into sliod and check
- authbuf file's parent dir should not be world readable so people can
  determine key size
   - make default authbuf key size much bigger, and random size
- breleasethr 'skip due to not expire' should put such bmaps at
  the end of the list and stop processing when encountering one
- ensure buffered IO mode with reads past EOF still issue RPCs to sliod
- pscrpc nbreapthr should not forced wakeup every second

unnecessary lock contention?

	- zhihui says no because kernel only allows on writer but this
	  should be double checked

- stkvers is not getting updated from certain clients/sliod

D-MDS
  make pool of MDS at each logical endpoint and uses consensus to
  establish leaders and use synchronous updating of all changes across
  each minipool (NVRAM)

make ability to pass FIDs around

- bulk CREATEs
	- (client) after 2-3 creates in a dir with an mtime that has not
	  changed outside of our own updates, piggyback a LEASEDIR flag
	  in the next CREATE
	- MDS sees a LEASEDIR request and checks if other clients have
	  READDIR or any modification to dir in question
	- MDS passes back a token and a block of 16 FIDs
	- if any modification or readdir on the dir happens, synchronous
	  wait (or timeout) on owning client until relinquishment
	- if timeout

	- O_SYNC
	- O_DSYNC
	- O_RSYNC
	- O_ASYNC
	- fsync(2)

if user owns directory and first CREATE worked, assume more will and
batch them up
	dir is OK for user
	quota is OK
	- LOOKUP is the way into a directory.
	- when a lease gets revoked, add a timeout on the dir for
	  X time
	-
	- any create operations should check if there is a lease and
	  perform it locally
		- access
		- release
		- flush -> flush bulk
		- create
	- allocate local fid?    map to same fcmh?

	- other areas ripe for bulk?

- track MDFS compressratio for historical purposes

is msctl -p fuse.debug broke (firehose6)?

mount_slash implement sys_splice?
vmsplice(2)

- check various tunables/stats (sizes, cache hits, hashtable sizes) on
  illusion2 zfs/arc
	- cache hits
	- file accesses
	- hash table sizes
	- file lookup latency
	- I/O sizes
	- open(2)'s accounting

- add contention stats for spinlocks, mutexes
  (time waiting; number of waiters)

- search /arc_s2ssd_prod/.slmd/fidns for nlink=1
- __attribute__ printf like sweep on all printf va_arg functions in tree
- mds_update_note() in mds rmc.c

- measure sync waiting on bmap in write()
- ETIMEDOUT during multithreaded I/O when no csvc immediately available
- dynamically scale number of compute-bound threads to available CPU -
  loadavg; io-bound (normal and readahead) threads to underlying storage
  parallelism: use generic worker threads and workq and scale wkthrs
  out to nprocs-loadavg

- gridftp IO block size? most IOs on grace are 1k, which is terrible

- introduce client nonce ID to identify when clients restart and we can
  eradicate old leases immediately
- measure effectiveness of 'write-behind': expiration and sending of
  batched up writes
	- latency vs throughput

- readahead is horrifically overallocating requests under some workloads

reminders:
- make sure a bunch of threads dont always do the waitq(&abstime)
  mechanism, creating a spike of spam activity every second: make an API
  with a random tv_nsec

- implement dynamically resizeable hashtables with reader-writer locks
- spread rcu?

make sure no fts() invoke ever does unlink() without checking that
	stat(root).inum != stat("/").inum

- interrupts received in hanging I/Os in multiwait_wait_cond should wake
  them up

- analyze various queue stats: listcaches, mlists
	- average length
	- average wait time
	- utilization

	mutex locks:
		U - the time the lock was held
		S - threads queued waiting on the lock
	thread pools:
		U - the time threads were busy processing work
		S - the number of requests waiting to be serviced by the thread pool
	process/thread capacity:
		U - total number of working threads;
		S - # work items queued
		E - are when the allocation failed (eg, "cannot fork").
	file descriptor capacity: similar to the above, but for file descriptors.

- bmap leases attached old fgen's to IOS servers that are down
  will infinitely wait when write IO is attempted

SLASH2 should immediately return an error when Frank compute nodes try
to access data with sense51-only residency

- track unused predictive accesses
   - writeahead
   - readdir_page

dsc snapshots
- document that upsch.db (and the backup) should be zapped during pool
  recreation

- how to detect concurrency in underlying FS?
	-> spawn N fs worker threads
	-> must adapt to conditions: scrub, degrade
	-> maybe monitor device IO queue size and dynamically adjust?

  - find /arc_sliod/$n/.slmd/fidns/ -depth 4 -type d

- choke readahead if performance is already at a max
- allow writes from fuse >1MB in the bmap flusher

- supply nonce to communicate instance ID to avoid DIO bullshit after
  restart for debugging sanity

s2re
- maybe create virtual queues for high-level user bandwidth reservation?

- mysql is broke on /crucible

- when connected to multiple NIDs, the first one should still be
  preferred in case the second NID tried happens to reply faster.
  really, all NIDs that work should be used and saturated as they can
  be.
- mount_slash has very poor streaming behavior (very bursty) when
  dealing with a slow IOS; resulting lots of timeouts, EIO, etc.

- move slash2 journal to an SSD on deployments
- bump client pagesize from 32k to something larger, perhaps 128k?
	- adapt pagesize for IO app is using?
- pscrpc_export leaking?  check any slmctl -sp
- add back blanket (ERANGE) assert to FUSE
- should usocklnd bind the local port to ACCEPT_PORT instead of the
  LNET_ACCEPTOR_MAX_RESERVED_PORT range?
- rqbd holds its own pool of pscrpc_request; switch to using PFL pool
  API proper
- NODIO support in MDS
- EDQUOT hit by awetzel@psc.edu
- du is broke on /crucible
- awetzel: use something better than tar
	- 0 length files
- can still trigger the read-returns-all-zeroes racy I/O bug
- psc_assert(msl_biorq_page_valid_accounting(r, i));
- still get SIGBUS in long running gdb sessions on fruits
- instead of set pfr_interrupted=1, perhaps reply immediately then let
  the fsthr no-op?
- 512-byte writes are only getting coalesced into 64k RPCs because of
  the definition of BMPC_COALESCE_MAX_IOV, although by my math it should
  be 16k..
- ENOSPC loops
- IOS is down and MDS crash loops trying to find op-reclaim.0
- try disabling BIOS config option C-states on firehose6 to avoid perf
  hangs
- when paging into upsch, hold items in cache instead of continually
  paging in single units so reduce SQL?
- does ptrunc adjust st_blocks-related fields correctly?
- MARKFREE is staying on clients in /pylon2 MDS and not clearing
- slvr_remove_all() is still causing problems because a sliver cannot
 clear
- convert IOS RECLAIM processing to the batch RPC API

zfs tuning
- tune metaslab_df_free_pct zfs/slashd
- try zfs_vdev_cache_size nonzero in SLASH2 MDS and IOS

- 01/11/2016: We still have connection issue: MDS can't contact IOS because
  it is down.  When I restart IOS (lime), it took ages to connect. Perhaps
  each side is waiting for the other side to respond its request first.

  * The client's idea of preferred IOS is not respected after that IOS is down and then up again.

  * After a replicate a file from lemon to lime, I kill lemon.  Then try to cat a file and it hangs.

    zhihui@yuzu: /zzh-slash2/zhihui/projects-stable-yuzu-2016-05-19$ cat TODO
    cat: TODO: Connection timed out

    Re-issue the command line while lemon is still down works fine.

----------

I was able to create 2000000 small files and remove them without problems (done in 23 hours).
but the memory is not freed afterwards:

zhihui@yuzu: ~/projects-yuzu/slash2/msctl$ ./msctl -p pool.dircachent.free

The CRC check fails in mds_inox_load_locked().  Need to investigate why and if CRC is really needed at all.

The problematic file is small (less than 3000 bytes), and yet its number of replicas is 24. As far as I know, 
no one is using replication on the particular file system.

----------

Remove BMAPF_REPLMODWR logic in replication code, it causes stalls for worker threads. Instead, we should
just make a copy of the bmap states.

Possible I/O performance regression, especially on read size:

Two new features:

 * sliod can request to push its replica of all files for decommision purpose (no client involvement).
 * subtree mount (this allows a VM to have root permission) - From Bob (an upcoming lustre feature).

An ACL bug?

zhihui@yuzu: /zzh-slash2/zhihui$ chmod o-rx testgroup
zhihui@yuzu: /zzh-slash2/zhihui$ getfacl testgroup
# file: testgroup
# owner: zhihui
# group: root
user::rwx
user:user1:r-x
user:user2:r-x
group::rwx
group:testgroup:r-x
mask::rwx
other::r-x			<-- does not change

It works for new directory though:

zhihui@yuzu: /zzh-slash2/zhihui$ chmod o-rx newdir
zhihui@yuzu: /zzh-slash2/zhihui$ getfacl newdir
# file: newdir
# owner: zhihui
# group: root
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::---

Hi Zhihui,

I found another bug with SLASH2 ACL implementation. This denies access rather than granting it,
so that is better. :)

In this case I have the /pghbio/data/tcga directory which has ACLs set for individual user
access, as well as group access by group tcga:

From directory /pghbio/data:

[blood@br006 data]$ getfacl tcga
# file: tcga
# owner: blood
# group: root
user::rwx
user:omedvede:r-x
group::r-x
group:tcga:r-x
group:tcgadmin:rwx
mask::rwx
other::---                              <-- this is key

If I add two more users with rx permissions using:

setfacl -m u:dsimmel:rx tcga 
setfacl -m u:susan:rx tcga 

Then the group 'tcga' gets permission denied! If I remove those rx permissions from dsimmel and susan using"

setfacl -x u:dsimmel tcga 
setfacl -x u: susan tcga 

Then access is restored to group tcga. (Note that the folder is also named tcga and the acl commands above 
refer to the folder named tcga, not the UNIX group).

Phil

Also, cp -p should copy ACL as well.

Make bigfile3.c work! race with read-ahead mechanism?  Our flush before read logic works on per bmap basis.
This might be have an issue with read-ahead code that can move into a different bmap.

A possible scenario to check: a write request wait for a read-ahead to finish, when the read ahead is done,
it clears the FAULTING bit, and then the write request continue to copy user data into buffer without the
protection of the FAULTING bit.   This only applies when msl_bmpce_complete_biorq() comes into play.

Perhaps try per-page synchronizing, all pages, regardless of whether it is being read or write, regardless
of whether it is valid or not, are marked FAULTING.

01/04/2017
----------

Test bigfile3.c fails when working on the same file successively. Looks like that the full truncation does 
not fully clear the local cache before proceeding.

Subject: reproducer for ifort compiler with IPO breaks down on /pylon2
Date: 	 Fri, 23 Sep 2016 13:42:20 -0400

If you run this on $HOME, /tmp or /pylon1 it works, if you run it on /pylon2 it fails. 
What makes it break on /pylon2 is the "-ipo" option (for inter-procedural optimization 
between code in different files). I believe this option results in the creation of 
temporary files that /pylon2 can't handle. I run make under strace() and see plenty 
of mmap's, but I can't tell if that is the root of the problem.

The get replication status RPC is very efficient.  Bob is running some script to verify files are really replicated elsewhere and it takes a very long time.

02/17/2017
----------

(1) Make sure we ignore unknown I/O servers when checking for the last replica of a block in a file. - FIXED

(2) An IOS is shown not connected to a client, double check that on-demand connection actually happens.


02/21/2017
----------

* More performance metrics are needed (average disk I/O time, RPC time).
* UID map should map a user to nobody if no explicit mapping for it exists (uid squash).

* If we disable write on an I/O server, make sure that we can read the old data store on it and write new
  data elsewhere.  If I wait a while, I seem to get the right result. Perhaps the client still think the
  copy at the old I/O server is still valid.

02/28/2017
----------

Gracefully online/offline an IOS (we have disable write, we need disable read as well).

With sparse-write.c, I can hit deadlock in an IOS as follows:

$ ./a.out file 200

Need more investigation - reclaim and writes on the same file cause deadlock
on the FCMH read-write lock.

05/01/2017
----------

Make sure all xattr operations never return ENOSYS.

05/10/2017
----------

Looks like fuselib3 turn on readdirplus by default.  We don't support that yet.

05/10/2017
----------

Random sigbus crashes happen when the machine is busy with other jobs, need to audit
all call sites of memory allocation.

05/11/2017
----------

Find a way to control the memory usage of slash2.


05/25/2017
----------

tar xvf ~/gcc-7.1.0.tar.bz2 
cd gcc-7.1.0/
./configure --disable-multilib
make

The above passes. But not the following:

make check

06/06/2017
----------

Make mds and ios run as non-root.

Potential ACL issue:

getfacl appears to be inaccurately reporting ACLs on /pghbio, although it
seems the correct rules (i.e., the ones we put in place to govern access to
tcga) are being enforced.

/pghbio/data/tcga is owned by me and belongs to the tcgadmin unix group,
under regular unix permissions:

[bradsol1@br005 data]$ ls -l
total 75
drwxrwx--- 36 blood tcgadmin 36 Feb 24  2017 tcga

Read access *should* be granted to all members of the 'tcga' group through
ACLs. If you look at the directory with getfacl, it appears that access is
NOT being granted to anyone beyond the regular unix permissions:

[bradsol1@br005 data]$ getfacl tcga
# file: tcga
# owner: blood
# group: tcgadmin
user::rwx
group::rwx
other::---

However, I *can* still enter this directory as user bradsol1, who is a
member of the 'tcga' group, but not 'tcgadmin'. If I try to enter the tcga
directory as a regular user (not in tcgadmin or tcga groups) I get
permission denied.

So, it seems that the original ACLs that we applied to this directory are
still protecting it (which is a relief), but the state of permissions is
*not* accurately reflected by the getfacl command, which makes it difficult
to track what is actually protected and what is not!

It was created a long time ago, but I think it would have been:

setfacl -m g:tcga:r-x /pghbio/data/tcga
